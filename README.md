# Description
This project showcases the development of a robust RESTful API for managing a book collection, designed to exemplify best practices in API design and implementation. The core functionality includes standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for book entries, with a focus on key aspects of API development. These include efficient data retrieval through basic caching mechanisms, ensuring data integrity with thorough validation, preventing abuse with rate limiting, graceful error handling for a smooth user experience, and implementing pagination for handling large datasets.

Beyond core functionality, the project emphasizes clear and comprehensive documentation.  JavaDocs provide detailed explanations of the codebase for developers, while OpenAPI documentation with Swagger offers an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring the API's endpoints and data models. This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in building a well-structured, reliable, and documented REST API, highlighting skills essential for modern web development.
